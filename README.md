# Unet_Based_Dental_Segmentation
 Project to develop dental X-ray segmentation models using U-Net and U-Net+ architectures, aiming to accurately segment individual teeth from dental images.

## Training Environment

The model was trained on a system with the following specifications:

- **GPU**: NVIDIA A100 80GB PCIe
- **CPU**: 16 vCore
- **Memory**: 192GB RAM

## Dataset

The model was trained using the dataset available at [Teeth Segmentation on Dental X-ray Images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/humansintheloop/teeth-segmentation-on-dental-x-ray-images).
